# Linux_Internal_Learning
Welcome to **Linux_Internals_Learning** ‚Äî a personal repository where I document and practice key concepts of Linux systems programming through hands-on C programs.
This collection includes short, focused programs that demonstrate my understanding of linux internals.

## 1. Simple File Logger
This is a basic C program that demonstrates how to perform file operations using Linux system calls. It periodically logs timestamped messages to a file (`log.txt`) and showcases key Linux internals like `open()`, `write()`, `close()`, `time()`, and `ctime()`.

### üõ†Ô∏è Concepts Covered
- File handling using `open()`, `write()`, and `close()`
- Time handling using `time()` and `ctime()`
- Working with file descriptors
- Using system-level sleep delays with `sleep()`
