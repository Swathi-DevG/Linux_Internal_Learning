# Linux_Internal_Learning
Welcome to **Linux_Internals_Learning** ‚Äî a personal repository where I document and practice key concepts of Linux systems programming through hands-on C programs.
This collection includes short, focused programs that demonstrate my understanding of linux internals.

## System calls: Info maintenance & File system

### 1. Simple File Logger
This is a basic C program that demonstrates how to perform file operations using Linux system calls. It periodically logs timestamped messages to a file (`log.txt`) and showcases key Linux internals like `open()`, `write()`, `close()`, `time()`, and `ctime()`.
#### üõ†Ô∏è Concepts Covered
- File handling using `open()`, `write()`, and `close()`
- Time handling using `time()` and `ctime()`
- Working with file descriptors
- Using system-level sleep delays with `sleep()`

### 2. File Copier with Offset
This program copies data from a source file to a destination file, starting from a user-defined byte offset.  
It is designed to showcase file reading and writing using system calls, along with offset manipulation using `lseek()`.
#### üõ†Ô∏è Concepts Covered
- Reading and writing files using `read()` and `write()`
- File descriptor manipulation with `open()` and `close()`
- Seeking file position using `lseek()`
- Handling command-line arguments
- Error checking and system call robustness
- Usage: ./file_copier_with_offset <source file> <dest file> <offset>

### 3. DUP-based I/O Echo (Without printf / scanf)
This program demonstrates how to perform standard input and output operations without using printf and scanf, instead using low-level system calls and file descriptor duplication via dup().
#### üõ†Ô∏è Concepts Covered
- System-level input/output with read() and write()
- File descriptor duplication with dup()
- Clean, low-level resource handling using close()

## Process Management

### 1. Simple Process Info Viewer
A basic C program that demonstrates retrieving the current process ID (PID), parent process ID (PPID), and displaying running processes using system("ps").
#### üõ†Ô∏è Concepts Covered
- `getpid()`: Get the process ID of the current process
- `getppid()`: Get the process ID of the parent process
- `system()`: Run shell commands from within a C program

### 2. Process Tree Simulator
This project uses the fork() system call to create a simple process tree with a main process, two child processes, and each child spawning a grandchild. Each process prints its PID, PPID, and role in the hierarchy.
#### üõ†Ô∏è Concepts Covered
- `fork()` : Creates a new process by duplicating the calling process.
- `getpid()` : Returns the current process ID.
- `getppid()` : Returns the parent process ID.
- Process hierarchy and how child/parent relationships are maintained.
