call is a procedure that provides the interface between a process and the operating system.
It is the way by which a computer program requests a service from the kernel of the operating system.
Different operating systems execute different system calls.
In Linux, making a system call involves transferring control from unprivileged user mode to privileged kernel mode; the details of this transfer vary from architecture to architecture.
The libraries take care of collecting the system-call arguments and, if necessary, arranging those arguments in the special form necessary to make the system call.

System calls are divided into 5 categories mainly :
Process Control
File Management
Device Management
Information Maintenance
Communication
